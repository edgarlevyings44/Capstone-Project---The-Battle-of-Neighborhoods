# Capstone-Project---The-Battle-of-Neighborhoods
Case study of Scarborough, Toronto


The final assignment of this course is the so-called "Capstone Project" in which many of the tools and methods learned throughout the recent months are applied in a self-chosen challenge around the general idea of a "Battle of Neighbourhoods", e. g. the analysis and useful preparation of data on venues in city environments. I chose the borough of Ville-Marie, Montreal as a case. To pass the final assignment, creating a Jupyter notebook with Python as the programming language and all the necessary code and comments is required, as are a blogpost or presentation and a final report. This is the required blogpost. Hope you like it.
